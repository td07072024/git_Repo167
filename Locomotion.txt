The red kangaroo's legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. They can reach speeds of around 60 km/h (37 mph).[19] The males can cover 8–9 m (26–30 ft) in one leap while reaching heights of 1.8–3 m (5 ft 11 in – 9 ft 10 in), though the average is 1.2–1.9 m (3 ft 11 in – 6 ft 3 in).
