This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a square shaped muzzle (snout/nose). They are sexually dimorphic; males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs, while females are smaller than males and are blue-grey with a brown tinge and pale grey below, although arid zone females are coloured more like males. It has two forelimbs with small claws, two muscular hind-limbs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used to create a tripod when standing upright.

Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3–1.6 m (4 ft 3 in – 5 ft 3 in) with a tail that adds a further 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) to the total length. Adult males are referred to by Australians as "Big Reds".[10] Females are considerably smaller, with a head-and-body length of 85–105 cm (33–41 in) and tail length of 65–85 cm (26–33 in).[11][12] Females can weigh from 18 to 40 kg (40 to 88 lb), while males typically weigh about twice as much at 55 to 90 kg (121 to 198 lb).[12][13] The average red kangaroo stands approximately 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) tall to the top of the head in upright posture.[14] Large mature males can stand more than 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) tall, with the largest confirmed one having been around 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) tall and weighed 91 kg (201 lb).
